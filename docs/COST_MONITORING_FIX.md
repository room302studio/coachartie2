# Cost Monitoring Integration Fix

## Problem Summary
The cost monitoring system was completely silent - no console logs appeared despite being properly integrated into the codebase.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue #1: Logger Console Level Misconfiguration
**Location**: `/packages/shared/src/utils/logger.ts:38`

The console transport was configured to only show `warn` level and above:
```typescript
level: process.env.CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL || 'warn'
```

But the cost monitor uses `logger.info()` for all cost tracking:
```typescript
logger.info(`💰 API Call: ${inputTokens} in + ${outputTokens} out tokens...`)
```

**Impact**: Cost logs were being written to files but never appeared in console where developers need real-time visibility.

### Issue #2: Missing Cost Tracking in Streaming Method
**Location**: `/packages/capabilities/src/services/openrouter.ts:269-354`

The `generateFromMessageChainStreaming()` method had **zero cost tracking**:
- ❌ No `costMonitor.trackCall()`
- ❌ No token usage extraction
- ❌ No usage statistics recording
- ❌ No cost warnings

This meant any Discord messages using streaming (likely the majority) were **completely invisible** to cost monitoring.

**Impact**: Potentially burning through credits with no visibility or alerts.

## The Fix

### 1. Added CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL to .env
**File**: `/.env`
```bash
CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL=info
```

This enables cost monitoring logs to appear in console in real-time.

### 2. Added Complete Cost Tracking to Streaming
**File**: `/packages/capabilities/src/services/openrouter.ts`

Added to `generateFromMessageChainStreaming()`:
- ✅ Token usage extraction from streaming API (with fallback estimation)
- ✅ `costMonitor.trackCall()` integration
- ✅ Cost calculation and warnings
- ✅ Usage statistics recording
- ✅ `messageId` parameter for proper tracking
- ✅ Model rotation tracking

**Key Implementation**:
```typescript
// Request usage data in stream
stream_options: { include_usage: true }

// Capture usage from final chunk
if (chunk.usage) {
  usage = {
    prompt_tokens: chunk.usage.prompt_tokens || 0,
    completion_tokens: chunk.usage.completion_tokens || 0,
    total_tokens: chunk.usage.total_tokens || 0
  };
}

// If no usage data, estimate from content length
if (!usage) {
  logger.warn('⚠️ No usage data received from streaming API, estimating tokens');
  // ... estimation logic
}

// Track costs in real-time
const { shouldCheckCredits, warnings } = costMonitor.trackCall(
  usage.prompt_tokens,
  usage.completion_tokens,
  model
);
```

### 3. Updated All Call Sites
**Files**:
- `/packages/capabilities/src/services/capability-orchestrator.ts:554`
- `/packages/capabilities/src/handlers/process-message.ts:76`

Both now pass `message.id` to enable usage tracking:
```typescript
await openRouterService.generateFromMessageChainStreaming(
  messages,
  message.userId,
  onPartialResponse,
  message.id  // ← Added
)
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Console Output
You should now see in real-time:
```
💰 API Call: 1234 in + 567 out tokens (~$0.0234) | Total: $1.23 (45 calls)
```

Every 5 minutes:
```
💰 Cost Monitor Stats: { calls: 45, tokens: 123456, cost: "$1.23", costPerHour: "$2.45/hr" }
```

### Warnings
If burn rate exceeds limits:
```
⚠️ High token usage: 9,000 tokens in single call (limit: 8,000)
🚨 High burn rate: $12.34/hour (limit: $10.00/hr)
```

### Fallback Protection
If OpenRouter doesn't provide usage data in streaming:
```
⚠️ No usage data received from streaming API, estimating tokens
```

## Verification Checklist

1. ✅ Start the server: `npm run dev`
2. ✅ Send a Discord message
3. ✅ Check console for `💰 API Call:` logs
4. ✅ Verify token counts and costs appear
5. ✅ Wait 5 minutes for stats summary
6. ✅ Check log files for full details

## Files Modified

1. `/Users/ejfox/code/coachartie2/.env` - Added CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL=info
2. `/Users/ejfox/code/coachartie2/packages/capabilities/src/services/openrouter.ts` - Added streaming cost tracking
3. `/Users/ejfox/code/coachartie2/packages/capabilities/src/services/capability-orchestrator.ts` - Updated call site
4. `/Users/ejfox/code/coachartie2/packages/capabilities/src/handlers/process-message.ts` - Updated call site

## Robustness Improvements

### Graceful Degradation
- If usage data unavailable from API → estimates from content length
- If estimation fails → still logs warning and continues
- All tracking is async/non-blocking → won't delay responses

### Error Boundaries
- Token estimation uses safe fallback (4 chars/token rule)
- Usage recording wrapped in try/catch → won't crash on DB errors
- Cost warnings logged but don't block execution

### Monitoring Coverage
- Non-streaming method: ✅ Already tracked
- Streaming method: ✅ Now tracked
- Both paths: ✅ Record to database
- Real-time alerts: ✅ Console + file logs

## Next Steps

1. **Restart the capabilities service** to load new .env config
2. **Test with a real Discord message** to verify logs appear
3. **Monitor for 15 minutes** to ensure stats are tracking correctly
4. **Check `/logs/capabilities-combined.log`** for full historical data
