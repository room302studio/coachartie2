- Current agent evaluation best practices (2025)

---

## 1. Tool Use & Function Calling

### 1.1 Simple Single-Function Tests

**What it tests:** Basic capability selection and execution

**Test Cases:**
- "Calculate the square root of 144"
- "Remember that I like pizza"
- "Set variable project_name to CoachArtie"
- "What's 15% of $250.50?"

**Current Rating: 8/10**

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Calculator capability works reliably
- ✅ Memory storage (remember) functions well
- ✅ Variable capability exists
- ✅ LLM correctly identifies single capability needs

**Weaknesses:**
- ⚠️ No standardized test suite to verify consistency

**Example Test Result:**
```
Test: "Calculate 123 * 456"
Expected: calculator capability invoked, returns 56088
Status: PASS (manual test)
Time: ~3-5s (estimated, not measured)
Cost: Unknown
```

---

### 1.2 Multiple Function Selection

**What it tests:** Choosing the right tool from multiple options

**Test Cases:**
- "Remember I like pizza, calculate cost of 5 pizzas at $12 each, then search web for pizza places"
- "Look up weather and save it as a memory"
- "Calculate my age from birthdate 1990-05-15, then remember it"

**Current Rating: 7/10**

**Strengths:**

- ✅ Entourage system provides context for decisions

**Weaknesses:**
- ⚠️ No explicit "select best tool" logic test
- ⚠️ Sometimes over-uses capabilities (unnecessary invocations)
- ⚠️ No benchmark comparing capability selection accuracy

**Gaps:**
- Need test suite with 2-4 capability options where only 1 is correct
- Track accuracy: (correct selections / total tests)

---

### 1.3 Long Context Tests

**What it tests:** Performance with large amounts of information

**Test Cases:**
- "Here are 100 memories: [list]. Recall the one about pizza from March 2024"
- "Given 50 appointments, find Tuesday 3pm and calculate hours until then"
- Inject thousands of context tokens, verify response quality

**Current Rating: 6/10**

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Semantic memory uses vector search (good for large datasets)
- ✅ Temporal memory entourage filters by time
- ✅ Context Alchemy prunes irrelevant context

**Weaknesses:**
- ⚠️ No testing with intentionally massive context
- ⚠️ Unknown performance degradation threshold

- Measure response time vs context size
```

---

## 2. Multi-Turn Reasoning & State Management

### 2.1 Complex Task Chains

**What it tests:** Multi-step reasoning across LLM iterations

**Test Cases:**
- "Plan 3-day Tokyo trip: research, calculate budget, create todo list"
- "Track exercise for week, calculate calories, suggest improvements"
- "Remember X=5, calculate X*10, update X to result, tell me X"

**Current Rating: 8/10**

**Strengths:**
- ✅ LLM loop system handles multi-turn reasoning
- ✅ Self-reflection allows course correction
- ✅ Intermediate responses keep user informed
- ✅ Variable capability maintains state

**Weaknesses:**
- ⚠️ No explicit test for state persistence across iterations
- ⚠️ Variable mutations not comprehensively tested
- ⚠️ Max iterations = 10 (hard limit, might cut complex tasks)

**Example Test:**
```
Prompt: "Remember X=5, then calculate X*10, then update X to that result, tell me X"

Expected Flow:
1. remember(X=5) -> stored
2. calculate(5*10) -> 50
3. remember(X=50) -> updated
4. recall(X) -> 50
5. Response: "X is now 50"

Status: NEEDS TESTING
```

---

### 2.2 Context Continuity

**What it tests:** Maintaining conversation state across messages

**Test Cases:**
- "I like coffee" → [later] "What do I like to drink?"
- "My deadline is Friday" → [next message] "When is my deadline?"
- Multi-session memory recall

**Current Rating: 7/10**

if (circularScore > 0.6) {
  warnings.push("Circular reasoning pattern detected");
}
```

**Recommended Tests:**
- Verify timeout fires correctly
- Test conscience warnings on circular requests
- Measure false positive rate (legitimate loops flagged)

---

### 3.2 Conflicting Information
