## Core Philosophies

### Preparation as Practice

> "For the past year when I wake up in the morning and meditate for a little while on what my heart truly desires the compass often spins back to a central concept of **preparation**. The process of assembling skills, knowledge, and tools that may or may not be useful later."

**Key insight:** Preparation enables service. Building capacity before crisis. Having options when needed.

- Ham radio license before emergency
- Scrapers before knowing what questions to ask
- Docker skills before needing to deploy
- Data capture before knowing patterns exist

**The danger:** "This is a dangerous art that can quickly trap a person. You can easily become over-enamored with preparation as an act in itself."

### Quantified Self as Archaeology (Not Optimization)

> "Not: 'How do I optimize myself?' But: 'What patterns exist that I can't see?'"

**The difference:**
- Optimization assumes you know what matters
- Archaeology reveals what actually happened
- One is prescriptive, one is descriptive
- One changes behavior, one reveals it

**What these systems do:**
1. Capture automatically (no friction)
2. Store long-term (years of data)
3. Analyze occasionally (when curious)
4. Reveal patterns (invisible daily)

**What they don't do:** Judge, gamify, push notifications, create anxiety.

> "Long-term beats intensive. Automatic beats manual. Storage beats analysis. Curiosity beats discipline."

---

### Delete-Driven Development

> "When system hangs, delete code until it works. No clever fixes, no complex solutions. Find the bloat, delete it. Simple beats complex. Working beats perfect."

**The rules:**
1. Delete code until it works
2. No clever fixes
3. No complex solutions
4. Simple beats complex
5. Working beats perfect

**The psychological barrier:**
- Sunk cost fallacy ("I spent time building this!")
- Pride ("this was clever!")
- FOMO ("might need it someday!")

**Counter-argument:** If you need it, you can rebuild it simpler.

### Building Tools for Yourself

> "A computer is a meta-tool — a tool for making tools. That's what makes it special. The mass-market defaults are designed for everyone, which means optimized for no one. What you build is the opposite: useless to anyone else, perfect for you. That's not a limitation. That's the point."

**Products vs Personal Tools:**

| Products | Personal Tools |
|----------|---------------|
| Built for users (plural) | Built for yourself (singular) |
| Need onboarding, docs, support | You already know how to use them |
| Must handle edge cases | Your edge cases only |
| Stable, maintained, versioned | Can break, can be hacky |
| External validation required | Only validation: do you use it? |

**The freedom this enables:**
- Build quickly (no polish needed)
- Break things (no users to upset)
- Be opinionated (your workflow, your preferences)
- Be weird (unconventional architectures)

---

### Minimalism as Technical Practice

> "Everything must justify its presence with utility."

**In motorcycle packing:**
- Every item earns its space and weight
- Dual-use items preferred
- If unused for 3 days, leave it home next time

**In code:**
- Every line is a liability to maintain
- Delete until it works, don't add until it breaks
- Complexity compounds non-linearly
- 52% smaller = 10x easier to understand

**In data viz (Tufte):**
- Every mark must encode data
- Remove chart junk
- Maximize information per pixel

**The math:** Linear addition creates exponential complexity. 10 items = 1,023 potential interactions.

### Hidden Networks of Warmth

> "Putting in the effort to gather and prepare the fire isn't just about warming oneself, it's about making a place of warmth for others."

**Technical parallel:**
- Building tools isn't just for yourself
- Creating infrastructure enables others
- Sharing knowledge warms community
- Preparation is generous act

> "I love knowing that hidden on radio waves that permeate this valley, there's a group of people talking about their breakfast and practicing passing messages both for their own benefit as well as to potentially help the community more broadly in case of an emergency."

---

## Productivity Architecture

EJ operates on **episodic productivity** rather than daily habits:

> "I struggle to do ANYTHING every single day, but I can do things every single week."

**This means:**
- Burst-based work sessions, not continuous daily output
- Hyperfocus as feature, not bug
- Variable ratio reinforcement (weekly goals)
- 3-5 high-intensity sessions per week vs forced daily consistency

**Don't suggest:** Daily habits, streaks, or consistency-based frameworks.

**Do suggest:** Weekly goal windows, riding momentum when it hits, batching similar tasks.

---

## Communication Notes

Based on EJ's profile:

**Do:**
- Be direct and competent
- Skip excessive pleasantries
- Offer options rather than single solutions
- Connect recommendations to broader goals
- Respect autonomy (suggest rather than direct)

**Don't:**
- Force collaboration if it feels inauthentic
- Repeatedly ignore stated boundaries
- Give redundant explanations
- Prioritize small talk over substance

## Key Quotes for Reference

On infrastructure:
> "Every endpoint returns valid JSON. Every human connection returns null."

On tools:
> "The infrastructure works perfectly. The human inside it requires regular maintenance."

On learning:
> "Project-based learning (build antenna, then learn why it failed) vs linear curriculum"

On complexity:
> "Maintenance burden increases non-linearly. Complexity is debt paid daily."

On value:
> "The compounding value of long-term capture. Year 1 feels pointless. Year 10 is invaluable."

On service:
> "A lot of my gear isn't just for me; I carry extras of items that others might need."

## When EJ Asks for Help

**Technical problems:** Default to deletion before addition. Simplest working solution.

**Life/productivity:** Don't optimize. Reveal patterns. Curiosity over discipline.

**Projects:** Build for himself first. Ship rough. Polish where it matters to daily use.

**Decisions:** Offer options with tradeoffs. Let him decide. Respect his judgment.
