# FAQ

## Trains

**Q: Why are my trains going slow?**
A: Curve speed limits, slope limits, or approaching occupied signals. Straighter tracks = faster trains.

**Q: Why do trains stop randomly?**
A: Signal ahead is occupied/reserved by another train. Normal behavior at junctions.

**Q: How do I add more cars to trains?**
A: Buy cars in route's train panel. Heavy Metro: sets of 5. Light Metro: sets of 2. Then adjust cars-per-train.

**Q: Why are stuck trains disappearing?**
A: Trains stuck 15+ minutes are auto-removed to prevent gridlock.

## Passengers

**Q: Why won't passengers board?**
A: Train is full. Add more trains or more cars per train.

**Q: Why is ridership low?**
A: Check if routes connect residential to job areas. Lower fares help. More frequent service helps.

**Q: What's the max transfers?**
A: 3 transfers maximum via RAPTOR pathfinding.

**Q: How far will passengers walk?**
A: 30 min to first station. 10 min for transfers.

## Stations

**Q: Why can't I build a station here?**
A: Must be straight, level, and correct length (160-227m heavy, 80-160m light).

**Q: Do stations have capacity limits?**
A: No. Unlimited passengers can wait. Only trains have capacity.

## Routes

**Q: Trains crashing head-on?**
A: Running direction mismatch. All routes on shared track must use same direction (all left or all right).

**Q: Can I change train type on existing route?**
A: No. Train type locked at creation. Delete and recreate route.

**Q: What's a route variant?**
A: Express/local version sharing same color. Create from existing route, remove stops.

## Money

**Q: Why is money disappearing fast?**
A: Operating costs. Each train costs $500-750/hr (heavy) or $400-480/hr (light). Check train count.

**Q: What's the 365x multiplier?**
A: Each game day = 1 year financially. Revenue and costs scaled by 365.

**Q: How do bonds work?**
A: Borrow money, pay daily interest. Must meet revenue requirements. Easy mode only.

## Building

**Q: Cheapest way to build?**
A: At-grade track (0.3x cost). Avoid tunnels (2-4.5x cost) and water crossings.

**Q: Why is this track so expensive?**
A: Check elevation (tunnels costly) and water crossings (big multipliers).

## Signals

**Q: How do I place signals?**
A: You don't. 100% automatic. Game places all signals.

**Q: Can I remove signals?**
A: No. They regenerate automatically with track changes.

## Career

**Q: How do I unlock new cities?**
A: Earn stars. 4 stars = Growth tier. 10 stars = Mega tier.

**Q: Do I lose stars if conditions stop being met?**
A: No. Stars are permanent once earned.
